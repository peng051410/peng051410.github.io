At Firehose, we like to call this the inflection point of coding. After this phase, the way you operate as a developer will be dramatically different. <code>Building up to the inflection point is the process of becoming self-sufficient in programming, to the point where you no longer need any hand-holding.</code> It can be a frustrating experience, but once it’s behind you, it is incredibly empowering.</a></li>

Although we do teach these skills and more, <code>our primary goal is to accelerate students past the inflection point so they gain the ability to solve any problem they encounter</code>. We believe that being able to problem solve on your own is an invaluable skill, and this method of teaching will take you much further than simply learning how to build a set of apps.</a></li>

Once you master certain tasks, the broad strokes of how the pieces fit together will start to become apparent. Over time, you’ll begin to recognize patterns and eventually, the things that initially seemed confusing and foreign will become second nature.</a></li>
    <li><a href="#for-students-starting-out-the-most-important-skill-to-acquire-is-attention-to-detail-dot">For students starting out, the most important skill to acquire is attention to detail.</a>

Seeing error messages is a frustrating experience at first, but it’s a crucial step in the learning process. Dealing with error messages and problems in this phase teaches you one of the most important skills of programming within a safe environment: being detail-oriented.</a></li>
        <li><a href="#debugging-error-messages-is-incredibly-important-dot-the-fact-of-the-matter-is-error-messages-are-just-a-part-of-programming-they-are-seen-by-inexperienced-and-very-experienced-developers-alike-dot-the-only-difference-is-the-more-experience-you-have-dealing-with-error-messages-the-less-time-you-ll-need-to-spend-trying-to-fix-them-dot-here-s-why"><code>Debugging error messages is incredibly important.</code> The fact of the matter is, error messages are just a part of programming: they are seen by inexperienced and very experienced developers alike. The only difference is, the more experience you have dealing with error messages, the less time you’ll need to spend trying to fix them. Here’s why:</a></li>
        <li><a href="#over-time-you-will-learn-how-to-read-error-messages-and-extract-the-relevant-details-of-the-problem-quickly-dot-the-first-time-you-see-an-error-message-it-will-take-you-a-while-to-decode-what-it-actually-means-dot-but-after-you-ve-seen-hundreds-of-error-messages--and-you-will-see-hundreds--you-will-be-able-to-pinpoint-the-problem-s-location-and-the-relevant-details-you-need-in-order-to-fix-it-dot">Over time, you will learn how to read error messages and extract the relevant details of the problem quickly. The first time you see an error message, it will take you a while to decode what it actually means. But after you’ve seen hundreds of error messages (and you will see hundreds!), you will be able to pinpoint the problem’s location and the relevant details you need in order to fix it.</a></li>
        <li><a href="#you-should-learn-from-each-error-message-that-you-resolve-dot-don-t-just-fix-the-error-and-be-done-with-it-understand-what-is-wrong-with-the-code-you-re-fixing-dot-by-learning-from-each-of-your-errors-the-next-time-you-make-the-same-mistake-you-ll-be-able-to-fix-it-much-faster-dot">You should learn from each error message that you resolve. Don’t just fix the error and be done with it; understand what is wrong with the code you’re fixing. By learning from each of your errors, the next time you make the same mistake, you’ll be able to fix it much faster.</a></li>
        <li><a href="#initially-you-will-probably-ask-for-help-on-each-error-message-you-see-dot-over-time-you-ll-learn-to-ask-for-help-less-frequently-by-double-checking-your-code-and-conducting-smart-google-searches-dot">Initially, you will probably ask for help on each error message you see. Over time, you’ll learn to ask for help less frequently by double-checking your code and conducting smart Google searches.</a></li>

At first, you’ll find it challenging to follow instructions and error messages will happen frequently. Over time, you’ll develop the skill to debug errors and pay better attention to small details, and you’ll be able to make progress much quicker. As you’re wrapping up the tutorial phase, you’ll notice you’re able to write code at a much more rapid pace.</a></li>

Other students will reach for more tutorials, trying to obtain more domain-specific knowledge in search of a “full understanding.” Unfortunately, tutorials will only take you so far, and true confidence isn’t found in tutorials or guides. <code>True confidence comes from struggling through a problem you have no idea how to solve, and discovering a solution on your own.</code></a></li>

Keep working. If you continue to struggle, try talking to someone who has recently passed the inflection point. They will be able to relate to the position you’re in and will assure you that what you’re experiencing is only temporary. Work consistently, but don’t overwork yourself. At this phase of the game, know that you can only be productive for around 6 hours a day at the most.

At Firehose, we like to call this the inflection point of coding. After this phase, the way you operate as a developer will be dramatically different. <code>Building up to the inflection point is the process of becoming self-sufficient in programming, to the point where you no longer need any hand-holding.</code> It can be a frustrating experience, but once it’s behind you, it is incredibly empowering.</h2>

Although we do teach these skills and more, <code>our primary goal is to accelerate students past the inflection point so they gain the ability to solve any problem they encounter</code>. We believe that being able to problem solve on your own is an invaluable skill, and this method of teaching will take you much further than simply learning how to build a set of apps.</h2>

Once you master certain tasks, the broad strokes of how the pieces fit together will start to become apparent. Over time, you’ll begin to recognize patterns and eventually, the things that initially seemed confusing and foreign will become second nature.</h2>

The first time you see an error message, it will take you a while to decode what it actually means. But after you’ve seen hundreds of error messages (and you will see hundreds!), you will be able to pinpoint the problem’s location and the relevant details you need in order to fix it.</h3>

At first, you’ll find it challenging to follow instructions and error messages will happen frequently. Over time, you’ll develop the skill to debug errors and pay better attention to small details, and you’ll be able to make progress much quicker. As you’re wrapping up the tutorial phase, you’ll notice you’re able to write code at a much more rapid pace.</h3>

Other students will reach for more tutorials, trying to obtain more domain-specific knowledge in search of a “full understanding.” Unfortunately, tutorials will only take you so far, and true confidence isn’t found in tutorials or guides. <code>True confidence comes from struggling through a problem you have no idea how to solve, and discovering a solution on your own.</code></h3>

If the tutorials you’re going through provide “challenges” or “self-directed” pieces, do all of them. <code>Solving unguided challenges will give you the important experience of doing things without structured guidance.</code></h3>

At Firehose, we often walk students through how to integrate certain gems or do things using the provided documentation. Rather than simply following the instructions explained in tutorials that are geared towards people who are just starting out, many students will follow the documentation and use the tutorials as a back-up. Note that documentation will treat you like a developer who has passed the inflection point. Getting comfortable reading and following documentation on GitHub will give you a leg up when you’re on your own.</h3>

<h2 id="pushing-through-the-inflection-point-can-be-challenging-dot-here-are-some-pointers-to-get-you-through-it">Pushing through the inflection point can be challenging. Here are some pointers to get you through it:</h2>

Also, set realistic expectations. You can’t compare your “superman”-level speed of going through tutorials to your “snail”-speed of learning things on your own. Keep in mind that you’re learning plenty, but at this phase, you’re learning a brand new skill of figuring new things out on your own.</h3>
<h3 id="if-you-re-struggling-with-self-confidence-know-that-what-you-re-feeling-is-completely-normal-dot-keep-working-dot-if-you-continue-to-struggle-try-talking-to-someone-who-has-recently-passed-the-inflection-point-dot-they-will-be-able-to-relate-to-the-position-you-re-in-and-will-assure-you-that-what-you-re-experiencing-is-only-temporary-dot-work-consistently-but-don-t-overwork-yourself-dot-at-this-phase-of-the-game-know-that-you-can-only-be-productive-for-around-6-hours-a-day-at-the-most-dot-working-in-an-exhausted-state-will-only-prolong-the-time-you-spend-building-up-to-the-inflection-point-dot">If you’re struggling with self-confidence, know that what you’re feeling is completely normal. Keep working. If you continue to struggle, try talking to someone who has recently passed the inflection point. They will be able to relate to the position you’re in and will assure you that what you’re experiencing is only temporary. Work consistently, but don’t overwork yourself. At this phase of the game, know that you can only be productive for around 6 hours a day at the most. Working in an exhausted state will only prolong the time you spend building up to the inflection point.</h3>
<h3 id="the-best-way-to-gain-confidence-at-this-stage-is-to-power-through-any-doubts-you-have-dot-your-emotions-may-start-to-feel-like-a-roller-coaster-dot-at-times-you-ll-feel-like-you-re-on-fire-but-after-15-hours-of-struggling-on-the-same-problem-it-s-very-common-to-feel-the-polar-opposite-dot">The best way to gain confidence at this stage is to power through any doubts you have. Your emotions may start to feel like a roller coaster. At times, you’ll feel like you’re on fire, but after 15 hours of struggling on the same problem, it’s very common to feel the polar opposite.</h3>

After solving a handful of hard problems without any help, you’ll be addicted to the feeling of building things outside your comfort zone.</h3>

Acceptance that the feeling that you’ve successfully learned everything just means you should start thinking about solving more complicated problems.</h3>
