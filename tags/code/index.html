When you learn to code, there is a moment when everything begins to change. At Firehose, we like to call this the inflection point of coding. After this phase, the way you operate as a developer will be dramatically different. Building up to the inflection point is the process of becoming self-sufficient in programming, to the point where you no longer need any hand-holding. It can be a frustrating experience, but once it’s behind you, it is incredibly empowering. At Firehose, our goal isn’t just to teach you Ruby, how to build web applications, or how to write tests. Although we do teach these skills and more, our primary goal is to accelerate students past the inflection point so they gain the ability to solve any problem they encounter. We believe that being able to problem solve on your own is an invaluable skill, and this method of teaching will take you much further than simply learning how to build a set of apps. The first step to becoming a self-sufficient developer is learning how to do specific tasks. Once you master certain tasks, the broad strokes of how the pieces fit together will start to become apparent. Over time, you’ll begin to recognize patterns and eventually, the things that initially seemed confusing and foreign will become second nature. For students starting out, the most important skill to acquire is attention to detail. Paying close attention to detail is important when going through materials like documentation or tutorials. Even the most minor typos and misspellings will result in error messages or bugs. Seeing error messages is a frustrating experience at first, but it’s a crucial step in the learning process. Dealing with error messages and problems in this phase teaches you one of the most important skills of programming within a safe environment: being detail-oriented. Debugging error messages is incredibly important. The fact of the matter is, error messages are just a part of programming: they are seen by inexperienced and very experienced developers alike. The only difference is, the more experience you have dealing with error messages, the less time you’ll need to spend trying to fix them. Here’s why: Over time, you will learn how to read error messages and extract the relevant details of the problem quickly. The first time you see an error message, it will take you a while to decode what it actually means. But after you’ve seen hundreds of error messages (and you will see hundreds!), you will be able to pinpoint the problem’s location and the relevant details you need in order to fix it. You should learn from each error message that you resolve. Don’t just fix the error and be done with it; understand what is wrong with the code you’re fixing. By learning from each of your errors, the next time you make the same mistake, you’ll be able to fix it much faster. Initially, you will probably ask for help on each error message you see. Over time, you’ll learn to ask for help less frequently by double-checking your code and conducting smart Google searches. In the tutorial phase, you will follow instruction. At first, you’ll find it challenging to follow instructions and error messages will happen frequently. Over time, you’ll develop the skill to debug errors and pay better attention to small details, and you’ll be able to make progress much quicker. As you’re wrapping up the tutorial phase, you’ll notice you’re able to write code at a much more rapid pace. At this point, some people feel confident– like they’re ready to ditch the training wheels and start building things without structured guidance– and will happily dive into the deep end. Other students will reach for more tutorials, trying to obtain more domain-specific knowledge in search of a “full understanding.” Unfortunately, tutorials will only take you so far, and true confidence isn’t found in tutorials or guides. True confidence comes from struggling through a problem you have no idea how to solve, and discovering a solution on your own. The dirty little secret of programming is… You will never know everything you need to know to solve all your problems. Going into the journey, you probably envisioned yourself eventually learning everything you need to learn, and then being squared away. This moment will never happen. Programming is a life-long learning experience. Experienced software engineers seek to find solutions to problems they haven’t solved yet because it gives them the opportunity to learn more. If you find yourself waiting for the moment when you finally feel like you know everything there is to know about coding, know this: the day you’re waiting for will never come. And that is a wonderful thing. You will be ready to jump into the next phase of your journey when: You’ve seen enough error messages that they no longer startle you. Instead, you know how to decipher what they mean and where to look for the problems in your code. You’re a pro at Googling for solutions. When you’re working to add a feature or see a confusing error message, you know what to search for to find the information you need. You’re able to reference code you’ve written in other parts of your application and follow patterns within them, rather than always seeking out step-by-step instructions. The Inflection Point (2-4 weeks with the right mentality) The inflection point stage is one of the most frustrating stages of learning to code, but in many ways, it’s the only stage that matters. It’s the point when you phase out of using tutorials and begin solving problems for which no one has lined up a solution for you At some points, you will feel like you aren’t ready to tackle this phase and like you want to return to building something with an outline of exactly what to do. Don’t fall prey to this mentality. The reason you’ll feel frustrated is: During the inflection phase, you will be coding 10-20 times SLOWER than in the previous phase. You may start questioning yourself and wondering if you are actually capable of becoming a programmer. Feelings of insecurity and doubt are common in this stage. Despite the fact that you’ll feel like you’re learning and accomplishing things at a much slower rate, in reality, you are achieving the things that matter the most. While your domain-specific knowledge is screeching to a putter, everything you’re learning will be about procedural knowledge. Procedural knowledge is the ability to teach yourself what you don’t know along the way. When you need to implement a new feature, what type of Google search should you do? At this point in time, you’ll feel like you’re “in the dark” when it comes to many of the things you want to accomplish. Learning how to find the light on your own is critical because you can never know everything there is to know, so you need to be able to teach yourself how to solve the problem at hand. Most people do not realize that in order to learn to code, you need to learn both domain-specific and procedural knowledge. For the rest of your life, go outside your limits every single day Some software engineers stay inside their comfort zone once they find their footing. These types of programmers are known as maintenance programmers– not something you should strive to be. Instead, you should strive to go outside your limits every single day. The most common reason programmers quit their jobs is because “it’s not challenging anymore since I’ve solved all the interesting problems.” Rather than trying to pull coding projects into your comfort zone, you should be seeking out problems that are outside your current skill set. This is the only way to build on and expand your skills. In the words of a Firehose student upon passing his inflection point: I still feel like I’m in the deep end! I’m just getting more comfortable knowing that’s where I’ve got to be! Strategies for Passing the Inflection Point as Efficiently as Possible Because passing the inflection point is the most important part of learning to code, you should set yourself up to make the process as smooth as possible. This means you should start preparing while you’re in the tutorial phase and maintain the right mindset during this period of time. During the tutorial phase, take breaks from going over structured material and give yourself challenge problems along the way. For every handful of lessons, try to do something that is outside the scope of the tutorial you’re following. If the tutorials you’re going through provide “challenges” or “self-directed” pieces, do all of them. Solving unguided challenges will give you the important experience of doing things without structured guidance. Try to use tutorials as little as possible. At Firehose, we often walk students through how to integrate certain gems or do things using the provided documentation. Rather than simply following the instructions explained in tutorials that are geared towards people who are just starting out, many students will follow the documentation and use the tutorials as a back-up. Note that documentation will treat you like a developer who has passed the inflection point. Getting comfortable reading and following documentation on GitHub will give you a leg up when you’re on your own. Focus on the essentials and use repetition. Learn how to do common things like spinning-up an application from scratch, pushing a new app to GitHub and Heroku, and building a database migration early on Pushing through the inflection point can be challenging. Here are some pointers to get you through it: Understand that this is a difficult process and go easy on yourself. Also, set realistic expectations. You can’t compare your “superman”-level speed of going through tutorials to your “snail”-speed of learning things on your own. Keep in mind that you’re learning plenty, but at this phase, you’re learning a brand new skill of figuring new things out on your own. If you’re struggling with self-confidence, know that what you’re feeling is completely normal. Keep working. If you continue to struggle, try talking to someone who has recently passed the inflection point. They will be able to relate to the position you’re in and will assure you that what you’re experiencing is only temporary. Work consistently, but don’t overwork yourself. At this phase of the game, know that you can only be productive for around 6 hours a day at the most. Working in an exhausted state will only prolong the time you spend building up to the inflection point. The best way to gain confidence at this stage is to power through any doubts you have. Your emotions may start to feel like a roller coaster. At times, you’ll feel like you’re on fire, but after 15 hours of struggling on the same problem, it’s very common to feel the polar opposite. It can be frustrating to have no idea if something will take you 5 minutes or 5 hours, but every time you power through and successfully implement a new feature, the rush of confidence will be everything you need. After solving a handful of hard problems without any help, you’ll be addicted to the feeling of building things outside your comfort zone. How to know when you’ve passed the inflection point The final stage of the inflection point process is acceptance. Acceptance that software development is a process of continuous learning. Acceptance that the feeling that you’ve successfully learned everything just means you should start thinking about solving more complicated problems.

格式化/日志格式化 字符串判断 字符串处理，常见的如处理字符串的第一个/最后一个字符 String.format String.format()是一个格式化的方法，使用%为前缀来表示要格式化的内容占位，一般的使用方法为：
String.format("test result is %s", "success"); 但是当要格式化的占位符与参数个数不同时会发生什么呢？
占位符个数与参数个数相同 如上代码，可以正常进行输出: test result is success
占位符个数少于参数个数 String.format("test result is %s", "success", "other"); 可以正常打印，输出结果为: test result is success
占位符个数多于参数个数 String.format("test result is %s %s %s", "success", "other"); 抛出了异常java.util.MissingFormatArgumentException: Format specifier ‘%s’
问题总结 为什么占位符数少于参数个数可以正常执行，而多于参数个数却报了异常？看JAVADOC发现，如果占位符个数少于参数个数，则多余的参数被忽略，如果多于参数个数，则在进行解析时会判断待处理占位符位置与参数个数，主要代码逻辑如下：
if (args != null && lasto > args.length - 1) throw new MissingFormatArgumentException(fs.toString()); 所以在使用String.format方法 切记 要参数个数多于待解析占位符的个数，这种问题常因为Copy操作后，处理了部分参数而忘记对应处理占位符
替换方案
目前看到很多的老代码打印日志时大都使用String.format()，可以改成slf4j的{} 还可以使用Apache common utils中的StringUtils.joinWith()或者Google guava的Joiner连接器 Apache commons utils-StringUtils 在StringUtils中有一个isNumeric方法，用来判断字符串是不是数字，那下面的代码会返回什么呢？

JAVA中的NULL处理 众所周知，在Java代码中总是少不了一堆的判null逻辑，在代码bug中，NullPointerException出镜率也是非常高的，尤其是现在的主流分布式架构，一个web接口要调用后端的N个RPC服务来实现功能，基于防御编程的思想，判null就更重要了
在处理NULL时怎么做更好 IDE 既然无法避免null，IDE就给程序员增加了可以快速判断空的功能，比如在IDEA中，可以使用Postfix功能，在对象上o使用.nn来快速输入if(o != null) {}
JAVA基础类库 近期的JDK版本也针对null判断增加了一些实用的方法
Objects类 JAVA8在Objects工具提供了isNull()和nonNull()方法，JAVA9又增加了requireNonNullElse()和requireNonNullElseGet()来给待处理对象增加设置默认值的方法
知名三方库 Apache common utils中提供了非常多的判空工具类，如针对String操作的StringUtils类和针对集合操作的CollectionUtils、MapUtils、ListUtils、SetUtils，这几个类都有一些典型的方法来进行判空处理，通用的方法如下：
StringUtils isEmpty()/isNotEmpty()
判断String是否为空/不空
isBlank()/isNoneBlank()
判断String是否为空/不空，这类方法还会判断实际值是否为空串
defaultString()
此方法允许在String为null时为返回空串
defaultIfBlank()/defaultIfEmpty()
此方法允许在String为空串或null时设置一个默认值
集合类Utils isEmpty()/isNotEmpty()
判断集合是否为空/不空
emptyIfNull()
这是一个很有用的方法，当传入对象为空时则返回设置的默认对象，可以很好的根治if处理null的问题，下面两段代码演示一下
正常情况下有if判断 List&lt;Object> values = rpcClient.getFromRpcList(); if(CollectionUtils.isNotEmpty(values)) { return values .forEach(System.out::println); } 使用emptyIfNull方法 return CollectionUtils.emptyIfNull(rpcClient.getFromRpcList()) .forEach(System.out::println); 这样保证了代码编写的连贯性，爽！
此方法在ListUtis、MapUtils、SetUtils中也有提供
defaultIfNull()
此方法允许在集合为null时设置一个默认值，也是可以链式操作
优秀的Coder 在编写通用方法时，对于有null返回的情况可以使用返回默认值来代替null
不返回空，以空对象来代替 比如返回一个new Object()
